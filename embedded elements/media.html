<!-- Any website must be able to engage well with its visitors, be entertaining, and be able to quickly deliver information.

Embedding content like audio clips, videos, images, maps, and so on... are a great way of engaging, be entertaining and be able to quickly deliver information to the website users.

Pictures or moving pictures, maps, etc. typically draw user attention and trigger quite a lot of emotions. Humans find it easy to connect to such information, rather than having to go through textual information.

This is why HTML provides tags for embedding media content like audio, video, and images and also for embedding external content like maps.

HTML5 supports the following types of embedded elements:

audio
video
image
iframe -->

<img src="Summit.png" alt="image unavailable"/>


<!-- We can also provide a caption for the embedded images.

HTML provides a semantic element <figure> along with <figcaption> element which help us to provide caption for our images.

For example, consider the following code. -->

<figure>
    <img src="tropicalSea.jpg"
         alt="An image of tropical sea"
         width="400"
         height="341">
  
    <figcaption>A colorful tropical sea view</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Audio Element:

Embedding audio to a web page can be done with <audio>...</audio> tag. The <audio> tag has an attribute 'src' which defines the location of the audio file. It also has an attribute 'controls' which specifies whether to display the player controls. -->

<audio src="audio.mp3"  controls="controls"></audio>
<!-- Content between <audio> and </audio> tag will be shown by browsers who do not support audio element. -->

<!-- Attribute	Value	Description
loop	Boolean- any value sets it to true	Loops audio indefinitely
autoplay	Boolean- any value sets it to true	Plays audio indefinitely
preload	none-preloading
metadata- audio metadata is downloaded
auto- entire audio file is downloaded	Specifies whether audio should be preloaded or not
muted	Boolean- any value sets it to true	Mutes audio -->

<!-- 
Video Element:

Videos can be embedded into web pages using <video>…</video> tag. The <audio> tag has an attribute 'src' which defines the location of the audio file.  It also has an attribute 'controls' which specifies whether to display the player controls. -->

<video src ="myVideo.mp4" controls="controls"></video>
<!-- Content between <video> and </video> tag will be shown by browsers who do not support the video element. -->


<!-- 
Some of the attributes which are supported by video element are as follows:

Attribute	Value	Description
loop	Boolean- any value sets it to true	Loops audio indefinitely
autoplay	Boolean- any value sets it to true	Plays audio indefinitely
preload	none-preloading
metadata- video metadata is downloaded
auto- entire audio file is downloaded	Specifies whether the video should be preloaded or not
height	pixel	Specifies the height of the video player
width	pixel	Specifies the width of the video player
poster	URL of an image file	Displays image until the first frame of the video is downloaded
muted	Boolean- any value sets it to true	Mutes audio
  -->

  <!-- Source Element:

All browsers do not support all audio/video formats. Therefore, the audio/video element allows you to list multiple sources with the <source> element. The <source> element has an attribute 'type' which specifies the type of the file.

The browser iterates through all sources one by one until it finds one which it can play. It should be noted that while listing the audio/video formats, it should be in the order from most desirable to least desirable to avoid the number of unnecessary iterations.

Also, it is suggested to use the <source> element within the audio/video element instead of the src attribute. -->

<audio>
   <source src="myaudio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
   <source src="myaudio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

<!-- 
We might have requirements to include documents, videos, interactive videos, or even other web content into a web page directly from external sources
The <iframe> element is used to meet the above requirement. Using the iframe element, contents from external sources can be integrated anywhere on our web page 
It is defined using <iframe>…</iframe> tag
. -->
