<p>Web developers can use the new features in HTML5 for building hybrid applications that can run on the web and mobile devices. Lots of data flow has to be handled in these applications, therefore developers should take care of the attacks that are possible as well. For example, an attacker can steal the data by inserting some wicked code through HTML forms which will be kept in the database. Security flaws are possible if proper security measures are not taken when using HTML5 features like communication APIs, storage APIs, geolocation, sandboxed frames, offline applications, etc.

<p>
Therefore there is a need to find the attacks possible in all-new HTML5 features and their preventive measures to defend against those attacks.

<h3>HTML Security </h3>
<p>
As HTML applications are web-based applications, developers should take proper measures to safeguard 
the stored data and communications. An attacker can inject some malicious code via Bluetooth/wifi/text messages for mobile-based apps 
or via advertisements/emails for web-based apps. This malicious code can capture sensitive information and can expose it to the attacker 
or it can run some undesired operations internally like sending false messages or purchasing a product with zero amount etc.
