<!-- Sometimes users will observe some unexpected data getting rendered on a web page. This might be due to a lack of proper validation for input and output on that page. So, a web developer should always check if input and output are properly validated before getting rendered on a page as this can lead to HTML injection attacks. -->

<!-- Let us now understand what is this attack and its consequences. -->
<!-- 
What is HTML Injection?
HTML Injection is one of the possible attacks in HTML5 apps. HTML Injection is an attack where an attacker can inject malicious HTML code into a vulnerable web application.  An attacker can send malicious code through HTML input fields or website links. Malicious code can be simple HTML tags that display some information on the page or a form replacing the original page etc., This kind of vulnerability happens when user input is not properly sanitized or the output is not properly encoded.

How HTML Injection is Performed?
An attacker will first find the vulnerable parts of a web application by inspecting the source code in the browser. Vulnerable parts may be HTML form fields or website links through which an attacker will inject some malicious HTML code. There are many attributes or methods which can render data on an HTML page. If malicious code is injected using innerHTML property and if the data is not properly sanitized, then it will lead to this attack. document.write() method is another way to inject the malicious code. It is used mostly for form input fields like comments box, registration forms, questionnaire forms, etc., These kinds of elements are most vulnerable to HTML Injection attacks.

The main intention of this injection attack is to either change the website's appearance or to steal the user's identity. -->

<!-- Example:
Following is the malicious HTML code an attacker injects through a website URL: -->

<div id="div1">hello</div>
<a href="http://example.com/home.html?username=<img%20src='image1'%20onerror=alert('error')">click </a>

<!-- 
Types of HTML Injection
There are two types of HTML Injections:

1. Stored HTML Injection
In this injection, the malicious code injected by an attacker will get stored in the backend and will get executed whenever a user makes a call to that functionality.

2. Reflected HTML Injection
In this injection, the malicious code will not get code stored in the webserver rather will be executed every time the user responds to the malicious code.

 

How to prevent HTML injection?
HTML Injection will happen if data is not properly validated. So we need to do proper data validation to prevent this attack. We need to check if data contains any HTML tags and then needs to be removed. This is done differently in different languages or frameworks.

Below are a few mitigation techniques to prevent this attack:

1. Use safe Javascript methods like innerText in place of innerHTML

2. Code Sanitization: Removing illegal characters from input and output refers to HTML code sanitization.

3. Output Encoding: Converting untrusted data into a safe form where data will be rendered to the user instead of getting executed. It converts special characters in input and output to entities form so that they cannot be executed. For example, < will be converted to &lt; etc.,

Let us now check out an example that demonstrates how the two types of injection attacks are arise. -->

 
<!-- Here an attacker is sending an image assigned to the username parameter embedded in a URL.

    Following is the vulnerable code which doesn't validate or sanitize the data: -->
<script>
var position = location.href.indexOf("username=");
var user = location.href.substring(position+5);
document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML = "Hello, " + user;
// This code is extracting the username position and fetching the value assigned to it. 
//It displays the image injected by an attacker in a div tag and runs some malicious script through it.
// Following is an example of using the document.write() method: 

// document.write("<h1> Hello, " + user + "</h1>");   

</script>
