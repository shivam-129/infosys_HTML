   <!--   Output:

Displays the output of user input.

For example, consider the below code snippet: -->

<form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
  <input type="number" id="b" name="b" value="10" /> +
  <input type="number" id="a" name="a" value="10" /> =
  <output name="result" for="a b">20</output>
</form>
<!-- The 'oninput' attribute carries the logic of generating the output, and the 'for' attribute of <output> tag specifies the control for which output has to be calculated. 
The above-given code would populate two input fields on the web page and the sum of the values of these two input fields is generated dynamically based on user activity on this page. 
The output of the above code snippet will be as shown below:


Note: A disabled attribute can be used with any input type to restrict user interaction. 
For example, a button can be made non-clickable, Checkbox can be made non-selectable.  
The output may vary for some input elements according to the browser. -->
